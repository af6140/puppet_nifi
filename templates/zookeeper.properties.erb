# Specifies the servers that are part of this zookeeper ensemble. For
# every NiFi instance running an embedded zookeeper, there needs to be
# a server entry below. For instance:

<% @zookeeper_members_hash.map do |key, value| -%>
<%= key %>=<%= value %>
<% end -%>
#
# The index of the server corresponds to the myid file that gets created
# in the dataDir of each node running an embedded zookeeper. See the
